                    Researching under Professor Kim at Korea University, I organized and managed a project that automatically determines likelihood to play tennis by discerning condition of a clay tennis court. The steps to construct a structure to automate this process, I collected images of tennis court in same angle through installed IP Camera, made two datasets: 'CAN' and 'CANNOT',and built a structure. The structure was constructed in order to learn from dataset, determine the status of the court, and derive the result. After learning from train directory, the model was tested by images from train directory and showed 70% of accuracy.
